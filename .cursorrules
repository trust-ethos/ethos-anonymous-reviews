# Cursor Rules for Ethos Anonymous Reviews

## Git Workflow
- **ALWAYS** commit and push changes after making any code modifications
- Use descriptive commit messages that explain what was changed and why
- Format: `git add -A && git commit -m "descriptive message" && git push`
- This ensures all work is backed up and version controlled

## Code Style
- In the web service, use emotion css instead of style. This looks like css={()} not css``
- Everywhere, use the actual character like ' not &apos;
- In the emporos service, use tailwind instead of style
- Do not hallucinate. Do not make up library functions. Ask for files or documentation you need.

## Fresh/Deno Specific
- This is a Fresh framework project running on Deno
- Use Preact components and signals for state management
- Islands are client-side interactive components
- Routes are server-side rendered pages
