# Discord Webhook Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up Discord webhook notifications for new anonymous reviews.

## ðŸŽ¯ What You'll Get

When a new anonymous review is submitted, your Discord channel will receive a rich embed notification with:

- **Review Type**: Positive/Negative/Neutral (with color coding)
- **Reviewer Level**: Reputable/Exemplary user indication
- **Target Profile**: Link to the reviewed user's Ethos profile
- **Review Content**: Title and description
- **Blockchain Links**: BaseScan transaction and Ethos review links
- **Privacy**: No user identity revealed - maintains anonymity

## ðŸ”§ Discord Setup

### Step 1: Create a Discord Webhook

1. **Open Discord** and navigate to your server
2. **Right-click on the channel** where you want notifications
3. **Select "Edit Channel"**
4. **Go to "Integrations" tab**
5. **Click "Create Webhook"**
6. **Give it a name** (e.g., "Ethos Reviews")
7. **Copy the Webhook URL** - you'll need this for configuration

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Discord Webhook Configuration
ENABLE_DISCORD_NOTIFICATIONS=true
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID/YOUR_WEBHOOK_TOKEN
```

**Replace the webhook URL with your actual Discord webhook URL.**

### Step 3: Test Configuration

You can test your Discord webhook setup using the test endpoint:

```bash
# Test the webhook
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/discord/test
```

Or for production:
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/discord/test
```

## ðŸ“‹ Configuration Options

### Enable/Disable Notifications

```bash
# Enable Discord notifications (default)
ENABLE_DISCORD_NOTIFICATIONS=true

# Disable Discord notifications
ENABLE_DISCORD_NOTIFICATIONS=false
```

### Optional Configuration

```bash
# If you want to disable notifications temporarily without removing the webhook URL
ENABLE_DISCORD_NOTIFICATIONS=false
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Notification Example

Here's what a Discord notification looks like:

```
ðŸŸ¢ New Positive Anonymous Review
A reputable user left an anonymous review

Target Profile: @username
Reviewer Level: reputable  
Sentiment: Positive

Review Title: Great collaboration partner
Review Description: Had an excellent experience working with this person on a DeFi project...

ðŸ”— View on BaseScan | ðŸ”— View on Ethos
```

**Color coding:**
- ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: Positive reviews
- ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow**: Neutral reviews  
- ðŸ”´ **Red**: Negative reviews

## ðŸ”’ Privacy & Security

The Discord notifications are designed to maintain anonymity:

- âœ… **No user identity revealed** - only reputation level shown
- âœ… **No authentication data** - no usernames or IDs
- âœ… **Public information only** - review content and blockchain data
- âœ… **Non-blocking** - notification failures don't affect review submission

## ðŸ›  Troubleshooting

### Webhook Not Working?

1. **Check webhook URL**: Make sure it's correctly copied from Discord
2. **Verify permissions**: Ensure the webhook has permission to post in the channel
3. **Test the endpoint**: Use the `/api/discord/test` endpoint
4. **Check logs**: Look for Discord-related errors in your application logs

### Environment Variables Not Loading?

1. **Restart the application** after adding environment variables
2. **Check .env file** is in the root directory
3. **Verify syntax** - no spaces around the `=` sign

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Test locally
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/discord/test

# Test production
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/discord/test

# Expected success response:
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Discord webhook test successful! Check your Discord channel for the test message."
}
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Production Deployment

### For Deno Deploy:

1. **Go to your Deno Deploy dashboard**
2. **Click on your project**
3. **Go to Settings â†’ Environment Variables**
4. **Add the variables:**
   - `ENABLE_DISCORD_NOTIFICATIONS` = `true`
   - `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` = `your_webhook_url_here`

### For Self-Hosted:

Add to your production environment or deployment scripts:

```bash
export ENABLE_DISCORD_NOTIFICATIONS=true
export DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/your_webhook_url"
```

## ðŸ”„ Automatic Notifications

Once configured, notifications are sent automatically when:

1. âœ… **A review is successfully submitted** to the blockchain
2. âœ… **The transaction is confirmed**
3. âœ… **Discord webhook is properly configured**

The notification includes all relevant information while preserving user anonymity.

## ðŸ’¡ Tips

- **Use a dedicated channel** for review notifications to keep them organized
- **Set up channel permissions** so only relevant team members can see notifications
- **Test regularly** to ensure the webhook continues working
- **Monitor logs** for any Discord API issues

Your Discord notifications are now ready! ðŸŽ‰
